React Server Components (RSC) is an exciting new feature in React 18 that allows developers to build modern web applications with improved performance and scalability by rendering parts of a React app on the server instead of the client. This approach can lead to faster load times, reduced JavaScript bundle sizes, and better overall user experience.

## What Are React Server Components?

React Server Components are components that are rendered on the server rather than the client. They allow you to offload some of the rendering work from the client, which can lead to faster page loads and more efficient usage of resources. By rendering certain components on the server, React can send HTML directly to the client, bypassing the need to send large JavaScript bundles.

### Benefits of React Server Components

- **Improved Performance**: By reducing the amount of JavaScript needed on the client, the app can load faster, leading to better performance and user experience.
- **Smaller Bundle Sizes**: Server Components are not included in the client-side bundle, which reduces the overall size of the JavaScript code that needs to be sent to the browser.
- **Better Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Server Components work seamlessly with SSR, allowing you to create hybrid applications where some parts are rendered on the server and others on the client.

## How Do React Server Components Work?

React Server Components are designed to work alongside traditional React components, but with the key difference that they run only on the server. These components are fetched from the server on demand, and their content is rendered into the HTML that gets sent to the client.

```jsx
// Example of a Server Component
function ServerComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This content is rendered on the server!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
